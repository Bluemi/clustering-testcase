# clustering-testcase

Implementation of some clustering algorithms.

## Controls
- `c`: Toggles visualization of clustering algorithm
- `+` / `-`: Use more or less cluster centroids
- `a` / `A`: Use next/prev cluster algorithm
- `n` / `N`: Use next/prev image/distribution
- `2`: Show 2d point distribution
- `3`: Show images. Colors are interpreted as 3d points and clustered
- `r`: resample 2d distribution
- `Esc`: Quit the program
